## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` for package management

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/datamining-project.git 
cd datamining-project
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```

4. Navigate to the `preprocessing/` directory and open `preprocessing.ipynb` to begin working with the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is located in the `data/` folder. You can replace it with another dataset, but be sure to update file paths in the notebooks accordingly.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using scikit-learn pipelines
- Categorical encoding, scaling, and imputation for missing values
- Train-test split
- Exported feature matrix and target vector ready for modeling
